Issuu Full Stack Test

[Issuu](https://issuu.com/) is the world's leading digital publishing platform.

We're looking for new members to join our fantastic team. You have been selected to take two tests as part of the assessment of developer applicants.

## Javascript assessment

- Unpack js-challenge.zip (https://www.dropbox.com/s/8yb840tsodwk590/js.zip?dl=0). Follow the readme under the heading "I want to work on the tests; what do I do?".
- Please do the tests you see on http://localhost:4444/ pass (as many as you can). Hint: Start with "Best practices", the rest is harder.
- Return the zipped app directory with your answers inside.

## The Box challenge

- Visit this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jaaq7rkcfmstnf3/so-many-boxes.txt?dl=0.
- Solve the problem described in the text file.
- You're free to choose the implementation language.
- Send us your solution in an email, file or gist.

We must receive your answers to the tests within the next 7 days.

**When you solve the tests, we kindly ask you to not upload it on your GitHub account for public view.**
